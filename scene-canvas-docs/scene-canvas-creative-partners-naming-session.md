# Creative Partners Working Session – Scene Canvas Naming

**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Location:** Bedroom Director HQ – back room, windows cracked, ashtray overflowing  
**Attendees:**  
- Wieden+Kennedy (W+K) – Rebellion  
- Chiat/Day (CD) – Reverence  
- Steve Jobs (SJ) – Clarity  
- Hybrid (HY) – Best of all three  

**Agenda:**  
Name the new scene‑first prompt workspace inside Bedroom Director (ultimately shipped as “Scene Canvas” everywhere).

---

## 1. Warm‑up (a.k.a. The First Hit)

**HY:** (exhales) Okay, rules of the session: no boring product names, no enterprise jargon, and nobody says “Dashboard.”  
**W+K:** Or “Control Center.” If I hear “Hub” I’m walking out.  
**CD:** This isn’t a hub. It’s a sanctuary.  
**SJ:** It’s simple: we’re naming the place where the movie really lives. Not a feature list.  

**Working description (for everyone to react to):**
- A **scene‑first directing workspace** where projects are broken into scenes and shots.
- A **prompt studio** for image → video pipelines.
- It **links out** to all the generators; it doesn’t try to be the generator.
- It lives inside Bedroom Director as the “do the work” space.

## 2. First Round Names – Throw Everything on the Floor

**W+K (Rebellion):**
- *“The New Hollywood”* – too big for a product tab, better for a campaign.  
- *“Render Room”* – feels underground, smoky, but maybe too VFX‑nerd.  
- *“Shot Lab”* – has energy, but leans more photographer than director.  

**CD (Reverence):**
- *“The Studio”* – simple, sacred, but too generic for navigation.  
- *“Scene Chapel”* – beautiful, but we’re not starting a cult… yet.  
- *“Director’s Room”* – intimate, but could be anything from notes to tools.  

**SJ (Clarity):**
- *“Scene Studio”* – already in the docs; accurate, but a little flat.  
- *“Shot Board”* – like a shot list plus storyboards; descriptive, but narrow.  
- *“Director’s Desk”* – human, but doesn’t scream multi‑scene, multi‑tool.  

**HY (Blend):**
- *“Director’s Canvas”* – cinematic, visual, but slightly generic.  
- *“Scene Canvas”* – closer to what we actually built: a space where scenes live, not just shots.  
- *“Bedroom Studio”* – on‑brand, but confuses the whole site name.  

(Joint passes around again.)

**W+K:** “Scene Canvas” sounds like something you draw revolutions on.  
**CD:** It also sounds like a place you come back to in silence. A canvas has weight.  
**SJ:** And it’s honest. It’s literally a canvas of scenes. You can explain it in one sentence on a keynote slide.

## 3. Filters – What the Name Has to Do

They write these on the whiteboard, very slowly:

1. **Describe the job to be done** in plain language.  
2. **Feel cinematic**, not SaaS‑y.  
3. **Leave room to grow** (from v1 local workspace to future cloud + collaboration).  
4. **Fit in the main nav** next to `Tools`, `Prompts`, `Showcase`.  
5. **Sound good when you’re high** and talking about movies.  

Quick pass:

- “Scene Studio” → ✅ accurate, ✅ nav‑friendly, ❌ a bit generic, medium cinematic.  
- “Shot Lab” → ✅ energy, ❌ narrow (only shots), ❌ could feel technical.  
- “Director’s Room” → ✅ human, ❌ vague, ❌ not obviously about prompts/scenes.  
- “Scene Canvas” → ✅ descriptive, ✅ cinematic, ✅ expandable, ✅ nav‑friendly, ✅ sounds like somewhere you hang out and build a film.  

Consensus nods, light coughing.

## 4. Final Decision – Name + Tagline

**SJ:** Let’s not get cute with two names. We call it “Scene Canvas” everywhere — in the nav, in the docs, in the code. Bedroom Director already carries the bedroom idea.

> **Scene Canvas**

**CD:** (smiles) A canvas is where you return to. Where you start and where you finish. That’s right.  
**W+K:** And “Scene Canvas” sounds like a place where you pin up every shot that Hollywood told you you’d never get to make. I can work with that.  
**HY:** Perfect. Bedroom Director is the bedroom brand. Scene Canvas is the workspace name. Clean split.  

**Final name recommendation for Bedroom Director:**

- **Feature / product name:** `Scene Canvas`  
- **Nav label:** `Scene Canvas`  
- **Docs, repos, UI:** also `Scene Canvas` (no “Scene Studio” split)  

**Supporting taglines (pick based on context):**
- “Scene Canvas – Your directing cockpit for AI shots.”  
- “Scene Canvas – Build the film before you hit generate.”  
- “Scene Canvas – From bedroom wall to big‑screen storyboard.”  
- “Scene Canvas – Your bedroom studio for AI films.”  
- Buttons like: “Open your bedroom studio (Scene Canvas)”.

## 5. How It Lives in the Site

**Nav:**  
- `[Home] [Tools] [Prompts] [Showcase] [Scene Canvas]`

**On the Scene Canvas landing hero:**  
> “Scene Canvas is your scene‑first directing workspace.  
> Break your project into scenes and shots, build prompts that actually survive the pipeline, then send them out to the tools you already love.”

**In tools catalog CTAs:**  
- “Plan this shot in Scene Canvas”  
- “Send to Scene Canvas”

## 6. Recap (Read Back While Everybody’s a Little Too High)

- We do **not** rename the whole product line.  
- We **do** give the workspace a cinematic, honest name: **Scene Canvas**, and use it consistently everywhere.  
- We let “bedroom studio” live as poetry in taglines and buttons, not as a competing product name.  
- We position Scene Canvas as:  
  - The **place where your project actually lives**  
  - The **bridge between prompts and generators**  
  - The **thing you open when you’re serious about making a film from your bedroom**  

Meeting adjourned. Windows stay open. Someone mumbles “we don’t wait for greenlights, we roll on the canvas,” and everyone agrees it only sounds good right now.

## 7. Brand‑y Names, Modes, and Future Families

**HY:** Okay, one more hit and one more question: do we ever want Higgsfield‑style names? Popcorn, Soul, that whole vibe.  

**SJ:** That works when each model *is* the product. For us, Bedroom Director is the brand. Scene Canvas is the workspace. If we bury the function under a pun, we make onboarding harder.  

**CD:** “Bedroom Studio” is beautiful, but it sounds like the whole platform. It competes with Bedroom Director instead of sitting under it.  

**W+K:** Keep the clarity in the tab. Get weird in the copy. Scene Canvas in the nav; “your bedroom studio” in the spots.  

**Working rule they land on:**
- **Scene Canvas** = clear, cinematic feature name.  
- **Bedroom language** = lives in taglines and CTAs:  
  - “Scene Canvas – your bedroom studio for AI films.”  
  - “Open your bedroom studio (Scene Canvas).”  
- Future “Higgsfield‑style” names can show up as **modes or presets inside** Scene Canvas (e.g., trailer mode, storyboard mode) rather than replacing the core name.

## 8. Scene Canvas Modes – Clear Names with a Little Flavor

**Goal:** Give power users Higgsfield‑style flavor *inside* Scene Canvas without sacrificing clarity in the UI.

### Mode 1 – Storyboard

- **UI name:** `Storyboard`  
- **Internal codename (optional):** `Frames`  
- **Use case:** Planning sequences as static frames or key shots, especially for short films, ads, and music videos.  
- **Tagline:** “Storyboard – block your scenes before you touch a timeline.”  

### Mode 2 – Trailer Cut

- **UI name:** `Trailer Cut`  
- **Internal codename:** `Trailer`  
- **Use case:** Fast‑paced 15–60s edits, sizzle reels, teasers, TikTok/shorts versions of longer projects.  
- **Tagline:** “Trailer Cut – cut the hype version of your story.”  

### Mode 3 – Clips

- **UI name:** `Clips`  
- **Internal codename:** `Clips`  
- **Use case:** Ultra‑short social shots, memes, loops, reaction overlays – anything under ~15s.  
- **Tagline:** “Clips – punchy shots for the feed.”  

### Mode 4 – Lookbook

- **UI name:** `Lookbook`  
- **Internal codename:** `Lookbook`  
- **Use case:** Style frames, character looks, palettes, and worlds with no obligation to cut a full sequence yet.  
- **Tagline:** “Lookbook – lock the look before you roll.”  

**HY:** These live as tabs or presets *inside* Scene Canvas. The nav still just says `Scene Canvas`. The modes give us room to get poetic where it doesn’t hurt comprehension.
