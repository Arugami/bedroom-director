## 🎬 What Is This?

The Bedroom Director Universe is a complete fictional world built around the brand. Think Marvel Cinematic Universe, but for bedroom creators. Every product, location, and piece of content exists within this cohesive world.

**Core Concept:** A 90s/early 2000s theme park aesthetic meets bedroom creator culture. Everything feels like it could exist in a Spielberg film or a Universal Studios attraction circa 1998.
