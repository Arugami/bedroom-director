Generates ~1 second of video in tens of seconds on an A100 GPU. Not optimized for speed – focus was on cost-efficient training rather than fast inference. Further optimization or distillation may be needed for real-time use.","Free and open-source. Code and model weights are on GitHub (Apache 2.0 License). Anyone can use, modify, or even commercialize it (the aim is democratization). No royalties – just credit the project. Essentially the community alternative to Sora.",Completely open under Apache 2.0 – no usage restrictions baked in (aside from ethical AI guidelines). Users are responsible for safe use. HPC-AI Tech released it to spur innovation in video generation. This openness contrasts with most cutting-edge video models.,"Fast progress: Open-Sora 1.0 was mid-2024 (basic text2video). v2.0 released Mar 2025 with major quality leap. Likely ongoing academic-style releases – possibly v2.5 or v3 in 2026 if more funding. Community contributions (fine-tuned checkpoints) appear on HuggingFace, accelerating improvement.","Truly ""Sora for all"" – high-quality results approaching closed models, but at a fraction of training cost (~$200k) thanks to clever optimizations. Gives researchers and smaller companies a fighting chance in video AI. A milestone in open AI like Stable Diffusion was for images.",,"Still somewhat experimental – not as plug-and-play or stable as polished models. Motion can be less fluid in complex scenes. No built-in content filters – risk of misuse (users must handle moderation). And running it demands powerful GPUs (accessibility is relative – easier than training $2M models, but still heavy to run locally for most).",HPC-AI Tech,
Tencent,VIDEO_GEN,Open-Source,Open-Source,REGIONAL,Intermediate,"Production,Social Media",HunyuanVideo,Text-to-Video,"Open-source large T2V model (13B parameters) launched by Tencent in late 2024. Trained on multi-modal video data to achieve high visual quality, diverse motions, and strong text alignment. Claims performance comparable or superior to previous SOTA closed models. Also provides an image-to-video mode (HunyuanVideo-I2V) for single-image animation.","Demonstrated ~5 s videos at 1024×576 in 24 FPS. Can do up to 128 frames (5.3 s at 24 FPS) per generation per the paper, with potential for longer if stitched.","Text prompt input; optional image input mode. Supports various styles (the model learned diverse ""themes""). They released both T2V and I2V model weights. Like most open releases, no official GUI – use via code or community UIs. A live demo site exists (China region) for text-to-video with limited daily quota.","As a large 13B model, inference is heavy – ~10 seconds of video might take a few minutes on multi-GPU setups. Tencent optimized it to some extent (they mention efficiency improvements), but speed is not real-time. Good for batch generation on cloud GPUs.",Free. Model weights on Hugging Face under an open license. Tencent also provides a free web tool (in Chinese) for anyone to try limited generations. No subscription needed. Essentially a public contribution to open AI research (likely to enhance Tencent cloud offerings indirectly).,"Open-source (likely Apache 2.0 or similar). Meant to be used and adapted widely. Commercial use is allowed (Tencent itself might use it in products). It's part of Tencent's ""Hunyuan"" AI platform strategy – they open-sourced to gain community adoption.","Released Dec 2024. No major update as of Oct 2025 publicly, but ongoing internal research presumably. It was a one-time big release; future ""HunyuanVideo 2"" might depend on research direction. Meanwhile, community is fine-tuning it (e.g. custom models on HuggingFace).","First Chinese open model at parity with Western closed models. Excellent at complex motions and understanding Chinese text prompts (multilingual capability). Being open, it fosters global research and integration, raising the bar for non-English video generation especially.",,"Hardware intensive (13B model + video frames means needing at least an A100 GPU to run smoothly).

Aims to close the quality gap to closed models. It's a diffusion-based video model released in late 2024 as a preview.,Shown generating ~3–4 s clips at 512×512 (12–16 frames @ ~4 FPS). Meant to demonstrate short dynamic motions (e.g. a person doing a quick action). Longer sequences possible by chaining but not primary use.,"Text prompts only. Genmo provided a hosted demo and Docker to run Mochi. No special control inputs beyond the prompt. Designed to be simple: input text, get video. Community can integrate it into notebooks or UIs (e.g. RunPod, Modal examples exist).","Moderate speed: a few seconds of video in perhaps ~30–60 seconds on a high-end GPU (roughly ~2× image generation time times number of frames). Genmo likely used optimized pytorch for release, but still not real-time.","Free and open. Available on GitHub/Hub (MIT license via Genmo). Genmo had a free online demo (during preview launch) to showcase it. They might build paid products on it eventually, but the model itself is open.","Very permissive open-source (MIT). You can use it in any projects. Genmo's ethos is community-first, so they released Mochi to spur innovation and gather feedback. No usage restrictions coded, aside from general responsible AI advisories.","Released Nov 2024 as ""preview"". Genmo hinted at continuing improvements (Mochi 2 etc.) but no major public release as of late 2025. The project is active on GitHub with updates to improve stability. We might see an official ""v1"" when it's more refined.","Strong motion realism among open models – e.g. ""exceptional motion consistency"" reported by early testers. Good prompt alignment too. Essentially one of the best fully open text-to-video as of 2024, moving the needle for community models.",,"Still a preview: occasional flicker between frames, and resolution is limited (for higher res, needs interpolation/upscaling). Also lacks advanced features (no audio, no control nets). Some users report it struggles with very complex prompts or long dialogues in the scene.",Genmo,

CogVideo-X (2024) is an improved open model with better bilingual understanding and video coherence. Leverages transformer architectures and cogeneration techniques developed by Tsinghua.,Generates about 4 s of video (32 frames at ~8 FPS) at ~480p. Aimed at short social video snippets (e.g. someone doing an action with a caption).,"Text prompt input (Chinese or English). No additional controls. The model has some training on Chinese-specific content, making it culturally tuned. Provided as research code; no GUI from authors aside from example scripts.","Inference speed similar to other transformer-based video models of its size – not instant, but workable (within a minute for a clip on decent GPU). Not optimized for deployment (research code quality).","Free, open-source (released on GitHub under Apache License). No usage fees. Part of academic publication. Anyone can download weights and run or fine-tune.","Open license (Apache). Encourages research and even commercial experimentation (though model quality likely not fully production-ready without further tuning). Outputs should be used responsibly as usual, but no baked-in constraints.","Original CogVideo was mid-2022; CogVideo-X paper in mid-2024. These are research milestones, not productized. Tsinghua might not continually maintain it – it serves as a foundation for others to build on. The community might fine-tune it or incorporate techniques into other models.","Important for multilingual video generation – one of few models that understand Chinese text well. Open availability helps Chinese developers who might prefer it over English-trained models. Technically, it introduced some novel training tricks documented in the paper.",,"Quality is still behind Sora/Veo: videos are often low-res and occasionally incoherent on complex prompts. More a proof-of-concept than a competitor to closed models. Also, limited support/community compared to bigger open projects (fewer updates, less user-friendly packaging).",Tsinghua Univ.,

Can be extended by running multiple modules sequentially for longer or higher-res.,"Text prompt for base gen. Optionally use an image init or depth map with the ""extension"" models to better control output. The framework allows swapping in custom Motion LoRAs – e.g. you can train a LoRA for ""skateboarding moves"" and apply it. Essentially Lego blocks for video AI.","Speed: each module is comparable to an image diffusion run per frame chunk, so base ~20 s per video on good GPU, then extension a bit more. Overall not real-time but modular (you can skip or add steps as needed to save time or improve quality). Designed to be relatively efficient and run on one GPU.","Free, fully open-source (MIT license). Models and code on GitHub. No cost except compute. It's intended as a research and dev platform for open video AI – no subscription, etc.","MIT license – do anything you want. The authors encourage both academic and commercial use. There's no usage restriction, though they include a note urging users to avoid misuse (no baked filter).","Initial release late 2023 (VideoCrafter 1). Version 2 in mid-2024 with major upgrades. Ongoing community contributions (many LoRAs and fine-tunes shared on HuggingFace). Likely future versions will appear as video models evolve, possibly adding audio or longer sequence handling.",Highly extensible – one of the first open frameworks letting users *train their own motion modules* and plug them in. This means tailored outputs (e.g. a LoRA for a specific character or action) are easier. Great for developers wanting a customizable video generator rather than a fixed model.,,"As with many open models, raw quality is a notch below the likes of Sora or Runway. To get best results, one might need to run the extra refinement modules, which complicates usage. It's also a code-heavy tool – not a ready-made app for non-coders.
