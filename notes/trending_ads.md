## "Trending" Module Suggestions
- Feature 2-3 campaigns at a time with thumbnail, 1-line hook, toolstack callouts, and link to case study or social clip.
- Tag entries by **Outcome** (Ad, Short Film, Music Video), **Tools Used**, and **Complexity** so the site can filter by audience skill level.
- Include "Try This Stack" CTAs pointing directly to relevant model pages (e.g., Reve Video, Veo 3.1 Fast, Secret Level partner listing once available).
