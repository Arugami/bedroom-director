# Scene Canvas Docs Overview

This folder contains the working documents for the Scene Canvas feature. Use these as the primary references:

- `scene-canvas-implementation-spec.md` – Source of truth for routes, data structures, UX/layout principles, and MVP implementation details.
- `scene-canvas-strategic-analysis.md` – Core strategy and product reasoning behind Scene Canvas.
- `scene-canvas-image-to-video-pipeline-research.md` – Supporting research on creator workflows and pain points.
- `scene-canvas-user-case-study-mira-eli-sienna.md` – Case study capturing how key personas (Mira, Eli, Sienna) experience the current UI.

Additional persona details live in `research/personas/` (including `nova-ai-shortform-creator.md` for shortform‑first workflows).

Older or superseded drafts are kept in `archive/` for historical context. Do not treat anything in `archive/` as current unless explicitly referenced from the main docs.
