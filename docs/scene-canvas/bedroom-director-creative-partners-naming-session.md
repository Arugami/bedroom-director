# Creative Partners Working Session – Bedroom Director Naming System

**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Location:** Same back room, same ashtray, slightly stronger weed  
**Attendees:**  
- Wieden+Kennedy (W+K) – Rebellion  
- Chiat/Day (CD) – Reverence  
- Steve Jobs (SJ) – Clarity  
- Hybrid (HY) – Best of all three  

**Agenda:**  
Stop calling things “The Arsenal.” Build a clean, cinematic naming system for Bedroom Director’s core surfaces:
- Brand  
- Tools section  
- Scene workspace  
- Prompts library  
- Showcase  

---

## 1. Set the Ground Rules

**HY:** Last time we locked in **Scene Canvas**. Today: everything else.  
**SJ:** Same rule: the label should explain itself in one second. Witty goes in the tagline, not the nav.  
**W+K:** And no more “Arsenal.” We’re not sending creators to war; we’re sending them to set.  
**CD:** Names should feel like places in a studio, not features in an app.  

Working mental model:
- **Bedroom Director** = the dream.  
- **Nav items** = rooms in the studio.  

Current rough map:
- Home  
- Tools (a.k.a. “The Arsenal” in places)  
- Prompts  
- Showcase  
- Scene Canvas

## 2. Tools Section – Killing “The Arsenal”

**W+K:** “The Arsenal” sounds like we’re arming mercenaries. Fun line for a campaign, terrible everyday label.  
**CD:** It has the wrong violence. We’re not stockpiling weapons; we’re curating instruments.  
**SJ:** What is it really? It’s a **catalog of tools** with education layered on top. Say that.  

Names on the wall:
- *Tool Catalog*  
- *Tools*  
- *Director’s Toolkit*  
- *Tool Deck*  
- *Studio Rack*  

Quick passes:
- **Tool Deck** / **Studio Rack** → stylish but vague; you have to think.  
- **Director’s Toolkit** → nice phrase, but long and a little marketing‑ish for the nav.  
- **Tools / Tool Catalog** → boring in a good way; immediately clear.  

**HY:** Split the difference:  
- In the nav: **Tools** (simple, obvious).  
- On the page hero: “**Tool Catalog – every model that matters.**”  

**Decision – Tools:**
- **Nav label:** `Tools`  
- **Primary page name:** `Tool Catalog`  
- **Tagline examples:**  
  - “Tool Catalog – every model that matters.”  
  - “The right tool for every shot.”

## 3. Prompts – Making It Sound Like a Library, Not a Dump

What it is:
- Community and curated prompts.  
- A place you browse, study, and remix.  

Names on the wall:
- *Prompts* (current)  
- *Prompt Library*  
- *Prompt Vault*  
- *Script Library*  

**SJ:** “Prompt Library” says what it is and implies quality.  
**CD:** “Vault” is heavy; this should feel open, not locked.  
**W+K:** “Script Library” is poetic but confusing in an AI context.  

**Decision – Prompts:**
- **Nav label:** `Prompts` (short, familiar).  
- **Primary page name:** `Prompt Library`  
- **Tagline examples:**  
  - “Prompt Library – shots that already work.”  
  - “Steal like a director. Remix like an editor.”

## 4. Showcase – Screening Room vs. Flex

What it is:
- Finished work, case studies, inspiration.  

Names on the wall:
- *Showcase* (current)  
- *Screening Room*  
- *Premiere*  
- *Theater*  

**CD:** “Screening Room” is beautiful, but could sound like gated, invite‑only.  
**SJ:** “Showcase” is the clearest for web users. It’s not wrong. We can brand it in the hero.  
**W+K:** “Screening Room” as a hero line has energy: “Welcome to the Bedroom Director Screening Room.”  

**Decision – Showcase:**
- **Nav label:** `Showcase`  
- **Primary page framing:** “Showcase – the Bedroom Director screening room.”  
- **Tagline examples:**  
  - “Where bedroom cuts hit the big screen.”  
  - “Watch what the bedroom directors are shipping.”

## 5. Scene Workspace – Re‑affirming Scene Canvas

Already decided last session:
- **Name:** `Scene Canvas`  
- **Nav label:** `Scene Canvas`  

Today’s addition:
- Use “bedroom studio” in copy, not as a competing product name.

Copy hooks they like:
- “Scene Canvas – your bedroom studio for AI films.”  
- “Open your bedroom studio (Scene Canvas).”  
- “Plan it in Scene Canvas, render it wherever you want.”

## 6. Putting It All Together – Navigation & Naming Grid

**Final nav bar:**
- `Home`  
- `Tools`  
- `Prompts`  
- `Showcase`  
- `Scene Canvas`  

**Naming grid:**

| Surface        | Nav Label     | Internal / Page Name   | Example Tagline                                      |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Brand          | Bedroom Director | —                    | “From bedroom to big screen.”                        |
| Tools          | Tools         | Tool Catalog           | “Every model that matters.”                          |
| Prompts        | Prompts       | Prompt Library         | “Shots that already work.”                           |
| Showcase       | Showcase      | Showcase / Screening Room framing | “Where bedroom cuts hit the big screen.”   |
| Workspace      | Scene Canvas  | Scene Canvas           | “Your bedroom studio for AI films.”                  |

## 7. Higgsfield‑Style Flavor Without Losing Clarity

**HY:** If we ever want “Popcorn/Soul”‑type names, we use them as **modes inside Scene Canvas**, not in the top nav.  

Examples (for later):
- **Storyboard Mode** → could get a codename like “Frames”.  
- **Trailer Mode** → “Trailer Cut”.  
- **Short‑form / TikTok Mode** → “Reels Mode” or “Clips”.  

But:
- Top‑level labels stay boring‑clear: Tools, Prompts, Showcase, Scene Canvas.  
- The poetry lives in taglines, intros, and modes.

Meeting adjourned. Someone says, “We killed the arsenal; we opened the studio,” and this time it actually still sounds good in the morning.

## 8. Tone Guardrails – Late Night, Not Explicit

**Intent:** Bedroom Director can nod to “bedroom” and late‑night energy without becoming a sex site. Keep it cinematic, not explicit.

**Allowed vibes (green light):**
- Late‑night creativity: “Stay up all night. Ship by sunrise.”
- Oblique innuendo: “For the shots you can’t get in daylight.”
- Sleep/insomnia jokes: “For when your brain won’t power down.”
- “All‑night” language tied to work, renders, or premieres.

**Avoid (red lines):**
- Direct references to sex acts or porn categories.
- Anything that sounds like an adult site tagline.
- Objectifying language about bodies.
- Slurs or punchlines at the expense of queer/sex‑worker communities.

**Copy pattern to keep using:**
- Bedroom = **place** (where the work happens).
- Director = **role** (the person in charge of the story).
- Heat comes from **obsession with the film**, not from explicit content.
