## 📝 Brand Guidelines

### Do's
✅ Celebrate bedroom creators
✅ Use cinematic, moody photography
✅ Embrace 90s/early 2000s theme park nostalgia
✅ Keep it accessible and inclusive
✅ Build a world people want to be part of
✅ Use VHS grain, practical effects, real lighting
✅ Reference theme parks without copying IP
✅ Make it feel like a family vacation memory
✅ Balance nostalgia with modern functionality
✅ Embrace the late-night grind aesthetic

### Don'ts
❌ Don't be elitist or gatekeep
❌ Don't oversell or be salesy
❌ Don't lose the DIY, scrappy ethos
❌ Don't make it feel corporate
❌ Don't forget the "bedroom" in Bedroom Director
❌ Don't directly copy Disney/Universal IP names
❌ Don't over-polish the aesthetic (keep it grainy)
❌ Don't lose the 90s nostalgia factor

### The Irony We're Playing With
**Hollywood/Theme Parks say:** "Come to us, pay thousands, wait in line"
**Bedroom Director says:** "You're already there, it's free, start now"

We're using Hollywood's own language (theme parks, studios, premieres) to democratize creativity. The bedroom is the new studio lot.
