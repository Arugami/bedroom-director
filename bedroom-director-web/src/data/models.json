Like most open releases, no official GUI – use via code or community UIs. A live demo site exists (China region) for text-to-video with limited daily quota.",
      "speed": "As a large 13B model, inference is heavy – ~10 seconds of video might take a few minutes on multi-GPU setups. Tencent optimized it to some extent (they mention efficiency improvements), but speed is not real-time. Good for batch generation on cloud GPUs.",
