### 3. **AI Directory Monetization Reality Check**

#### From r/SaaS: "I built an AI tool directory, decent traffic but struggling to monetize"

**Common Monetization Challenges:**

#### Subscription Tiers (Proven)
- **Basic (Free)**: Browse models, basic search
- **Pro ($15/mo)**: Prompt library access, save favorites, weekly digest
- **Team ($49/mo)**: Collaboration features, shared workspaces
- **Enterprise ($199+/mo)**: API access, custom integrations, priority support

#### Alternative Revenue Streams
1. **Affiliate/Referral**: Partner with model providers (10-30% commission)
2. **Sponsored Listings**: Featured placement for new models ($500-2K/mo)
3. **Premium Content**: Exclusive tutorials, courses ($29-99 one-time)
4. **Job Board**: AI creator job listings ($99-299 per posting)
5. **Newsletter Sponsorships**: Sponsored sections in weekly digest ($500-2K)

**💡 INSIGHT FOR US:**
- Don't rely on ads alone
- Freemium with clear value in premium tier
