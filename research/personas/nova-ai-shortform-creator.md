# Persona: Nova – AI Shortform Creator / YouTube & TikTok

**Role:** Solo creator/director producing daily shortform videos (YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Reels)  
**Primary Mode:** Fast shipping (1–3 videos per day), format-driven series, strong focus on hooks and watch time  
**Seniority:** 3–5 years editing for social; 1–2 years experimenting with AI video and motion graphics  
**Core Tools Today:** Pika / Runway / Luma, CapCut / Premiere, Descript, Topaz Video AI, ElevenLabs, Canva / Figma

---

## Goals

- Publish **consistent, on-brand short videos** multiple times per week without burning out.  
- Turn rough ideas into **vertical, platform-ready clips** in hours, not days.  
- Maintain a **recognizable visual style** (characters, typography, color, pacing) across series and seasons.  
- Spend time on hooks, narratives, and pacing — not on re-wiring toolchains.

## Current Workflow (Simplified)

1. **Idea & Hook**
   - Keeps a running list of hooks in Notes/Notion (“What if X director shot Y commercial?”).
   - Uses ChatGPT/Claude for alt hooks and punch-ups.
2. **Visual Directions**
   - Generates key frames in Midjourney/Flux / Ideogram.
   - Experiments with short clips in Pika / Runway / Luma, often in 9:16.
3. **Assembly & Edit**
   - Brings clips into CapCut or Premiere; adds text overlays, sound design, pacing tweaks.
   - Uses Descript/ElevenLabs for VO and rough captions.
4. **Polish & Posting**
   - Punches up color and sharpness with Topaz / in-app filters.
   - Posts variants across TikTok, Shorts, Reels with slight tweaks to caption/thumbnail.

Total: 2–6 hours per video when things go well; longer when a concept is messy or the visual style drifts.

## Pain Points

- **Format fatigue**
  - Every new idea means rebuilding a structure: intro beat, core sequence, payoff, CTA.
  - No good way to reuse “episode skeletons” across a series.
- **Visual inconsistency**
  - Character and style drift across tools and over time; some clips look “off brand” in the feed.
- **Tool hopping**
  - Constantly bouncing between chat apps, image/video generators, and editors; context gets lost.
- **Decision overload under time pressure**
  - Too many generation options; hard to know when to stop iterating and ship.

## What Bedroom Director Must Do for Nova

- **Series templates, not just scenes**
  - Provide reusable **shortform templates**: e.g., “30s explainer,” “15s cinematic hook,” “3‑beat comparison.”
  - Let Nova save and reuse “episode skeletons” that carry beats, pacing notes, and preferred tools.
- **Vertical-first Scene Canvas**
  - Scene cards can still use the film aesthetic, but the workspace should make 9:16 and short runtimes first-class concepts (tags, meta, presets).
  - Reel Wall should make it clear how many scenes/beats fit in a 30–60s vertical piece.
- **Fast decision support**
  - For each scene/beat, show 1–2 recommended tools with tradeoffs (speed vs quality vs cost) so Nova doesn’t have to re-evaluate every time.
  - Simple status markers (“good enough to ship,” “needs pickup,” “experiment only”) visible on the Reel Wall.
- **Low-friction prompting**
  - Director Chat should specialize in crafting **hook-first prompts** and tight scene descriptions tuned to shortform pacing.
  - Quick actions to turn a chat idea into a scene card with prefilled notes and recommended models.

## Nova’s Take on the Current Scene Canvas UI

From Nova’s perspective:

- **Strengths**
  - The idea of a Reel Wall with scenes and a chat that remembers the project feels like a step up from “15 browser tabs and a Notes app.”
  - The Scene Inspector’s camera/lighting/style chips look like they could encode “series style” once dialed in.
- **Friction**
  - The current multi-scene layout (small numbered pills; large amounts of empty space) doesn’t yet look like a **shortform storyboard**. It feels more like a WIP dashboard than a tight vertical sequence.
  - The inspector reads as heavy and cinematic—good for 60s spots—but a bit overbuilt for fast shortform runs where Nova just needs “Scene 1: Hook shot,” “Scene 2: Payoff,” etc.
  - There’s no clear sense of **runtime or pacing** per scene; nothing reminds Nova that they’re building a 20–40s vertical arc.

## How Nova Can Help Us

- Co-design **shortform-first templates** for Scene Canvas (3–5 scene patterns with hooks and payoffs).
- Stress-test whether Scene Canvas can actually keep up with a 1–3 videos/week cadence without adding overhead.
- Help prioritize UI elements that matter under tight time pressure (hooks, runtime, status) vs those that can be tucked away.
