# Persona: Sienna – Agency Creative Technologist

**Role:** Creative technologist / innovation lead at a small agency or studio  
**Primary Mode:** Bridge between creative directors, clients, and AI tooling  
**Seniority:** 5–8 years agency experience; 1–3 years leading AI experiments

---

## Goals

- Use AI to **pitch and deliver** better creative work faster (brand films, social series, mood edits).  
- Maintain **brand consistency** and quality across many outputs, platforms, and campaigns.  
- Keep the team aligned on versions, prompts, and model choices under tight client deadlines.

---

## Current Workflow

- Receives briefs and brand decks; translates them into scripts, visual directions, and experiments.  
- Uses:
  - LLMs for script options, headline variations, and mood film concepts.  
  - Image/video models for key frames and rough cuts.  
  - Notion/Drive/Slack for prompt libraries, links, and feedback.  
- Manages multiple stakeholders:
  - Internal creatives and producers.  
  - Clients who want “options” and rationale.  
  - Occasionally, devs / ML engineers for custom pipelines.

## Pain Points (Mapped to Research)

- **Version hell**
  - Multiple prompts, exports, and edits with no clear single source of truth.
- **Brand drift**
  - Hard to enforce style, logo rules, and tone when experimenting across tools.
- **Handoff friction**
  - Moving from pitch decks to production to delivery requires re-creating context.
- **Client communication**
  - Needs to show options, explain tradeoffs (cost/time/quality), and quickly iterate.

## What Bedroom Director Must Do for Sienna

- **Project templates for brands**
  - Global style and character memory per client (visual themes, dos/don’ts, references).  
  - Reusable scenes and beats tuned to common deliverables (15s social, 30s brand spot, 6s bumper).
- **Clear comparison and rationale**
  - Compare tool / model options with pros/cons, cost/time implications.  
  - Attach prompts and outputs to scenes so she can show “Option A vs B” to clients.
- **Team-friendly Scene Canvas**
  - Scenes and beats that can be commented on, locked, and handed off between teammates.  
  - A single place where script, prompts, references, and output links live together.

## How Sienna Can Help Us

- Co-design “agency mode” for Scene Canvas and comparison flows.  
- Provide real client-like use cases to shape:
  - Brand-safe templates and global style settings.  
  - Presentation-ready views (for decks, reviews, and pitches).  
- Validate that Bedroom Director actually reduces coordination debt instead of adding another tool to manage.
