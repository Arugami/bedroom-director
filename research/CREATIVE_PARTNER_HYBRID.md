[W+K energy]

"They said you need millions.
We said: cool. We've got Wi-Fi."

[Slows down, elegant piano enters]
[Chiat/Day reverence]

Not in Hollywood. Here.
Between the noise and the silence."

It freed them.

And when you remove the limits...

We render them.

We built studios out of bedrooms.
Turned prompts into motion.
Turned dreams into dailies."
